Mini-blog is a website that allows you to post small blogs and pictures. You will be able to see
only your friends Mini-Blogs and you will be able to comment on each blog post.

Mini-Blog uses Spring Boot the Spring Security dependency and a Mysql database. The website is hosted
on heroku and uses the ClearDB plug in to connect to the Mysql database.
